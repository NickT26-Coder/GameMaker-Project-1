Top-Down Shooter     PC          Singleplayer


In a futuristic sci-fi gladiator arena, you are tasked with defeating all your opponents while piloting your own custom tank. The game is a top-down shooter, and your goal is to defeat the top ranked pilot and become the champion. In the game you will have to build your own futuristic armed to the teeth tank and then use it to defeat waves of enemies each level until you get to fight the final boss, the champion. If you get destroyed, you will have to start all over from the beginning.

The player will be faced with a variety of challenges in the way of obstacles and varied enemy designs they need to defeat until they fight the boss of that round. Each level will include an arena shaped for the enemies you will fight as well as obstacles. You will fight enemies in a round based format with a mini boss at the end that is in charge of that level. Each time you beat a level you will go up a rank and unlock tokens to unlock more parts to buy from the shop and with every enemy you destroy you get more credits to purchase parts from the shop.  

The first level will have regular tanks in a circular arena, the second one will have drill tanks that follow you around, the third will have long range tanks that harass you from afar. The fourth will have a lot more obstacles and the fifth will have a mixture of all elements and a final confrontation with the final boss. The key challenges of the game are learning what parts do what things and what you need to do to take advantage of the enemies presented to you as well as any obstacles you may face. Itâ€™s also important to learn how to pilot your tank well to beat the game.  

This game is meant for people who have a lot of fun tinkering around with customization options and the enemies just provide a nice target to test out combinations on, the game will have swappable chassis as well as turrets and 3 slots for abilities so players are encouraged to make a unique tank that is fun for them and even try to make as many as they want.
